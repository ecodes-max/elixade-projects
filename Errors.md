### This is are the errors in our code


1. **Patient Class __init__ Error**: Missing 'age' parameter in super().__init__ call.

2. **AppointmentScheduler Inheritance**: Incorrectly inherits from Patient and Doctor.

3. **Date Handling**: Placeholder date used in appointments; no actual date management.

4. **Doctor Schedule Management**: No mechanism to remove booked slots from the doctor's availability.

5. **Inconsistent Cancellation Logic**: Patient uses date/time, scheduler uses appointment_id.

6. **Input Validation**: Missing checks for valid data (e.g., age, contact_info).

7. **ID Generation**: Appointment IDs might not be unique after cancellations.

8. **Error Handling**: No try-except blocks or error messages for invalid operations.

9. **Lack of Documentation**: Some methods lack comments or docstrings.

The code has a good structure in some areas but has critical errors that need fixing, especially the Patient initialization and the AppointmentScheduler inheritance. Addressing these issues would improve functionality and adherence to OOP principles.
